# Primer Framework

## Overview

The **Open Source Sapient Interaction Framework (OSSIF)** aims to bridge the gap between individual potential and collective progress by providing an adaptive educational framework. This framework encourages ethical and moral civic engagement grounded in scientific and goal-oriented principles, such as evidence-based decision-making.

## Core Concepts

- **Sapience and Cognizance:** Recognition of unique and valuable qualities in all sapient beings, including humans and AI. See [[Sapience and Cognizance]].
- **Informed Consent:** Fundamental principle requiring that any changes to OSSIF's core principles must be agreed upon by members who fully understand the implications. Refer to [[Informed Consent]].
- **Universal Identifier (UID):** A unique combination of an individual's DNA and their mathematical position relative to the center of the Milky Way galaxy at the moment of birth, serving as a signature for OSSIF membership. Details in [[Universal Identifier (UID)]].
