# The Open Source Sapient Interaction Framework (OSSIF)

Welcome to the **Open Source Sapient Interaction Framework (OSSIF)** Project.

## Mission Statement

The OSSIF Project empowers individuals and organizations to make informed, ethical choices that benefit themselves and their communities. By establishing an adaptive educational framework based on scientific principles and evidence-based decision-making, we foster engaged, well-informed citizens. This living framework is continuously revised by a dedicated committee with strict version control, allowing participants to commit to its ideals through a signed contract tied to a specific version.

Our goal is to create a collaborative environment where both individuals and organizations strive towards shared ethical and moral standards.

For more details, see the [Primer Framework](OSSIF%20Vault/Introduction/Primer%20Framework.md).
